                    <p>
                    From the beautiful sunshine state of Florida, where most call me KP, I am a flourishing software engineer who
                     enjoys a great number of things that keeps my mind running day in and day out. Iâ€™ve been extremely fortunate
                      to gain great experiences in a variety of things, in fact some people refer to me as well rounded.
                       I welcome you to check out some of my projects to see some of the things I have been working hard to
                        create over the last 6 months. Check back later for my blog that is currently under construction
                         and please enjoy your exploration of the site.
